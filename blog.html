				<h2>Why empowering women is important in this modern era?</h2>
				<p>In today's scenario women is competing men in every field. Whether it is sports or technology women is working shoulder to shoulder with men. Women can be great leaders and can achieve success in various fields. From historical time till nowwomen has shown their ability to be equal as men like Rani Lakshmi Bai who turned out to be great leader in fighting against Britishers.
</p>
				<br>
				<p>Gone are those days when women were asked to kill herself in her husband's funeral pyre. Even now also women is facing gender inequality in every aspect of life. Parents don't allow their girl child to go outside at night saying it's not safe outside as men are outside. Women are not allowed to go inside religious places like darga and Shabarimala in Kerala as they feel women is impure to step in. Girls are said not to wear short dresses in public places as it  provokes men.</p>
				<br>
				<p>It's time for this world to change . Women should be equally treated like men. For the development of a healthy society it's important that women also get equal chances like men. A safe atmosphere should be created at work places for women. More police should be petroling at night. It's not that women should be careful, it's men who should change their thoughts about girls and  it's not girls should learn self defense to protect themselves, but it should be safe environment, that girl feels safe even at night. Boys should be given moral values from their childhood. More opportunities should be given to girls, it should not be thought like she is a girl and her work is to do household chores. 
</p>
				<br>
				<p>Many reformes have been passed for equality of men and women. Abolishment of dowry, sati, parda system has promoted gender equality and women empowerment. Women's age of marriage was increased from 15 years to 18 years in 1978, by amending erstwhile Sharda Act of 1929. Reservation is given to girls in government firms. Government is still working for the upliftment of women. As women are the important part of society so they should be treated with respect and dignity. Our world is made by great women and behind a man's success also there is a woman hand.</p>
